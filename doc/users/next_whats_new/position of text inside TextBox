Text can be positioned inside TextBox widget
---------------------

A new parameter called ``textalignment`` can be used to control for the position of the text inside the Axes of the TextBox widget. By default it is set to ``"left"``.

For example a textbox with the property set to "center" can be created through

``

from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
from matplotlib.widgets import TextBox

Box_input = plt.axes([0.2, 0.2, 0.1, 0.075])
text_box = TextBox(ax = Box_input, textalignment = "center" )

``
